/*
	This file loads all appropriate styling in order and is the main file that compiles all
	What weâ€™re achieving is a component that is:

    Scalable: as it can be added in any part of the page without any coding changes
    Extensible: as it can serve different functionalities with the core functions unchanged
    Maintainable: as it is organized in a way that makes sense

	To achieve SEM, BIO has been used including:

		Settings: Variables, Colors, Typo, Animation, Media Queries
		Don't use @extend, dependancies are hated.
		o- [object, block in BEM] as layout
		e- [element] (Dont' use the prefix) are base
		c- [component, element in BEM] for repeated stuff such as c-btn
		u- [utility, modifiers in BEM] used to tiny modifications without changing classes
	p- overriding patterns that aren't used scaleably

	classname=" o-grid__footer  " for reusability OR classname="o-grid__footer c-btn c-btn--font-24" for specificity
	classname=" o-header__overlays c-overlay-img"
